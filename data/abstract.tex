    根据微分几何中的曲面论，用两个变量就可以完全参数化一个二维曲面。也就是，当一个粒子约束在曲面上运动时，只需要两个独立的变量就可以完全刻画粒子的运动。

    According to surface theory in differential geometry, the two-dimensional surface is parameterized by two variables. This is, when a particle moves on the surface, only two variables suffice to describe the motion of the particle. However, when examining the same problem in the physical point of view, the motion of the particle can also be described in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
