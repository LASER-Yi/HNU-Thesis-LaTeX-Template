    According to surface theory in differential geometry, the two-dimensional surface is parameterized by two variables. This is, when a particle moves on the surface, only two variables suffice to describe the motion of the particle. However, when examining the same problem in the physical point of view, the motion of the particle can also be described in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
